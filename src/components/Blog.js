                    <p>When I was speaking on the perils of my social media usage I was reflecting on the "3rd digital space" I inhabit. What I mean by this is "that place" you always go to, your home page, your first stop. I'm trying to think way back, as far as I can, to the first days and I can't quite pin it but I think the first time I really had a "home page" I always looked at with Digg.</p>
                    <p>Digg, which was basically a site not too disimilar to Reddit, was a place with links. You go there, see what's trending, read some comments, etc. It was like opening the newspaper in the morning, there was a bunch of new stuff to look at and links to new places, articles, images, and banter about those things. I don't really remember what set it apart from Reddit, and I bring up Reddit because I was brought to Reddit from Digg in a story not unlike a lot of people about 12ish years ago... but before we get into Reddit, how I got into Digg was through Revision3.</p>
                    <p>Revision3 was an online video platform, something like a channel, or a studio, where they created programming (and licensed others) to be consumed not unlike a Nebula of today, but far fewer videos. Focus on tech, pop culture, and comedy. I am almost certain, without looking it up, it was meant to be a podcast network and they had the budget to do VIDEO podcasts... all of this predates YouTube, which is remarkable, but think back to the early days of online video. How did we even find anything? People shared links on forums I guess, but whatever the case may be, I made it to Revision3 by way of TechTV.</p>
                    <p>TechTV was a channel I used to watch that aired The Screensavers, Call for Help, and Extended Play, among others. Unabashedly techy, nerdy content. Like, you were going to talk about RAM, about displays, about the nitty gritty, and even though the vast majority of it went over my head, I ate it up. Extended Play, in particular, being a video game review show, was amazing. I loved Adam Sessler's energy and, a story many times retold, when TechTV was merged with G4 (a video game channel) the raw tech-heavy content was dulled out and eventually phased out. The Screensavers lived on with TWiT, with a favorite, Leo Laporte, going his way, but others went on to be featured on Revision3.</p>
                    <p>So it kind of starts with a television channel I used to watch on cable in high school. Moved to podcasts, then to Digg, then to Reddit.</p>
                    <p>Skipping about 12 years or so, I eventually cold-turkey'd Reddit a few years ago and that's how I ended up back in Instagram in search of somewhere to scroll and consume. I don't think anywhere is as efficiently entertaining as Reddit but Reddit is a mind killer, a time killer, and stepping away really challenged me to do something. Literally, just do something, other than stare at it. I ended up staring at other things but it was a huge step toward recovering my time. I did waste about a year and a half on Instagram, but quitting that, now only having BlueSky, which is just awful in comparison when it comes to content curation, means that, yes, I'm about to say it: I actually finally read a book</p>
                    <p>People, you've been on a wild, unedited, ride here on this one and it ended with the fact that I read a book to competion for the first time in about 14 years. I'm not a good reader, so I found out may be related to the ADHD, but more than anything, being so distractable (ADHD) and needing instant dopamine (ADHD) so cutting off the mind rot I got the time and will to read and... it was very fulfilling. I say this as though my reading days are over, I've only read about 3 books thus far, but still, that's an insane improvement.</p>
                    <p>I'll talk about what I've read later. Thank you for reading this, this thing that is rotting YOUR mind right now... perhaps you've been tainted and there's no going back, like a blot of sap that won't wash away and you can't see.</p>

                    <p>Oh hello there. I'm old now and I don't like social media. What an original state of being.</p>
                    <p>But for real, the last eight years have been very challening for me for two reasons. Reason one: Private. Honestly, I made a lot of decisions for myself at the expense of other people, some more than others. One could justify doing things that create pain for others, as one's own life may matter more than anyone else's. I don't know how to parse the complication of human existence where sacrifices are put upon other people can be rationalized as a good thing. I don't agree with that. All I can do for now, then, is not revel in it publically, not anymore than has happened (I can't control other people posting things).</p>
                    <p>With social media, like Facebook, which is the notable platform I left eight years ago, keeping it around for Marketplace and for anyone wanting to reach out through messanger or whatever, is that I didn't want to act anymore. So much of what we do online is an act and that's not a bad thing necessarily. We take pictures and put them in albums, write journals or blogs, or put together scrap books, which highlight what we want to highlight for whatever reason. There's nothing wrong with posting about the good things and people should feel emboldened to do that for their friends and family if it makes them happy. It's not for me and that's my prerogative, and I don't want to create that kind of content either. I like being weird and irrational at times, in my speech, and Facebook seemed to become less and less a place to be that and, well, I don't want to be that for an unwilling audience.</p>
                    <p>In any case, I was on Reddit at the time, got my kicks commenting and arguing online there, until finally I cold-turkey'd the place and went to Instagram where... you know, talk about regressing, but by the time I got on there full time I was looking at Reels, we were safely in the TikTok era, and content was flying by. At the same time I did start using the YouTube shorts feature as well, both being identical of course, but what isn't the same are the comments and the community. YouTube, shockingly, is more positive than Instagram. Instagram is hostile, people are awful on there, and it seems like eveyrone is fishing to get into an explosive debate and be the "correct one". I hate that. There were times were I felt like I had to be a good soldier fighting my side of this ongoing culture war, go all in, and it was effecting my personal life. I was becoming a grump, grumpier than normal anyway, and so in addition to that realization, and the realization that I'd never convince anyone of anything, and that you really don't know who you're talking to (bots, paid bad actors, ignorant morons), its not worth it.</p>
                    <p>I realized this isn't where the battlefield is. It's in the real world and there are real places where this change and these feelings I have about the world can be expressed and acted upon. Of course, I'm still not doing anything about it, but at least I'm not wasting my time and getting a false sense of having done somthing. So that's an improvement. I stopped using Instagram and, for my TikTok knock-off, I use YouTube shorts and that is actually a nice place to be if that's the kind of thing I want to stare at. Comments are kind.</p>
                    <p>The second thing, which maybe you've already surmised, was politics. Eight years ago was, roughly, the 2016 election. You know, what can I say. The world became more hateful and I didn't like seeing people I like express hatred and ignorance and, thus, I left. Sure, I steeped myself in the ignorance of complete strangers, which was foolish of course, and a major regression, but, as mentioned above, I stopped looking at IG too.</p>
                    <p>So where am I at? I am trying BlueSky but I am on the verge of leaving that as well. I never got into Twitter so a clone of that site isn't exactly enticing. I don't really like how performative the commenting is there, even if I'm in agreeance with what people are saying, you see a lot of copy-pasted opinions and kind of extreme takes from time to time. There's a hunger for extreme bias and that's kind of scary. Maybe we trace it back to the extremism on the Right, but these folks who are Left are tit-for-tatting and I kind of hate that. I'm definitely not a centrist, I have strong opinions, but I think its impossible to express anything in a 140 character limit. Truly. You can't. The world is way to complex and even though trying to placate everyone, give all due respects, you have to state yourself and you want to be able to get into it, and it not be just a performance for likes.</p>
                    <p>I can't keep going on about this but, you get the idea, right? See ya! Email me!</p>

                    <p>Greetings, all. This is Erik. You may know me from meeting me, from the internet, or from possibly never having met me at all. I am a person and I suppoe that counts for something.</p>

                    <p>This used to be where I had my resume and all that good stuff but right now I wanted to hijack this space as a personal place to share my thoughts with anyone who stumbles upon this page. I have linked this from various social media platforms, Facebook and Instagram if I'm not mistaken, not to mention LinkedIn!</p>

                    <p>I did this as though I had something important to say.</p>

                    <p>Why can't I just do it anyway? Sure, why not.</p>

                    <p>I often do these things and default to telling my life story, but how about this time I go in reverse chronological order? This last weekend was Memorial Day 2025 and it was a challenging time here at home. I have two children, one just turned 2 and the other is 4.5 years old. Its a tough set of ages, so I'm finding out, and my wife and I struggle often keeping sane amidst their insanity. They're both so young, they need so much from us, but its no longer a 24/7 struggle to keep them alive as it was when they were newborns (blessed to have uninterupted sleep at long last), so its hard to complain. That said, they're curious kids, they're feeling new emotions constantly, and we have to make sure they dont kill each other or kill themselves being so curious or so angry or so anything, feeling wild swings of emotion, and keeping up with them is laborious. Good thing they're cute. Maybe my new catchphrase.</p>

                    <p>I recently (in my life) found out I had ADHD and many of my past struggles make more sense. Relationships, school, jobs, it touches on all things in different ways, but what came to a head was how it relates to child rearing. These early years are non-stop and ADHD, in particular the executive dysfunction, is basically an impenetrable wall, or more accurately desribed, a deep well that I find myself unable to climb out of. I learned in my early adulthood how to overcome this which, unfortunately, involves dissassociating a little bit. I'm lucky to have a very patient partner in all of this. We both have our struggles but it would feel impossible without another person here to pass the baton to and to keep things in perspective. Another thing I've found myself doing is being even more dysfunctional in other aspects of my life as I put every ounce of my will into not being a deadbeat parent. Things like laundry, keeping up with friends, doing anything after bed time other than veg out... its a serious struggle but as the days go by and the kids get older and more independant its coming back, it really is, and I am thankful for that.</p>

                    <p>Something about ADHD is the oversharing. For the curious, lucky you!</p>

                    <p>Parents often only ever talk about their kids, its a good thing, but also, don't forget about the person you are. I am a person who has interests, hobbies, desires. Recently I started playing pickleball. Four years of sedentary life, working from home, it's not just about the Dad bod (which I rock proudly) but about stamina and strength. Pickleball is so low-impact, compared to other casual sports, the court being small, the ball not really not going that fast or far, and the fact that so many people play the game of all skill levels, means I have been able to jump in as a novice and get a good workout doing something fun. ADHD comes knocking again, I find normal exercise incredibly boring and I lose interest very quickly. Pickleball is a game and I like games, they are competative, and even though I am only on week 4 of playing the game, I'm finding the amount of physical effort is exactly where I'm at. I'm going to turn 40 next year and I suppose its time to let something like this stick. Plus, I get to befriend many old people. I'm surprised by how well people in their 70s can move.</p>

                    <p>That's all for today, folks. Feel free to email me: <a href='erikjustinportillo+blog@gmail.com'>erikjustinportillo@gmail.com</a>. If you're an old friend or anything don't be shy. I might not pick up the phone but I can write a damn long email and, plus, I'm more willing to send pics of whats going on in my life!</p>

                    <p>Goodbye~</p>
