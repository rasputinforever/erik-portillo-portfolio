                    <p>Greetings, all. This is Erik. You may know me from meeting me, from the internet, or from possibly never having met me at all. I am a person and I suppoe that counts for something.</p>

                    <p>This used to be where I had my resume and all that good stuff but right now I wanted to hijack this space as a personal place to share my thoughts with anyone who stumbles upon this page. I have linked this from various social media platforms, Facebook and Instagram if I'm not mistaken, not to mention LinkedIn!</p>

                    <p>I did this as though I had something important to say.</p>

                    <p>Why can't I just do it anyway? Sure, why not.</p>

                    <p>I often do these things and default to telling my life story, but how about this time I go in reverse chronological order? This last weekend was Memorial Day 2025 and it was a challenging time here at home. I have two children, one just turned 2 and the other is 4.5 years old. Its a tough set of ages, so I'm finding out, and my wife and I struggle often keeping sane amidst their insanity. They're both so young, they need so much from us, but its no longer a 24/7 struggle to keep them alive as it was when they were newborns (blessed to have uninterupted sleep at long last), so its hard to complain. That said, they're curious kids, they're feeling new emotions constantly, and we have to make sure they dont kill each other or kill themselves being so curious or so angry or so anything, feeling wild swings of emotion, and keeping up with them is laborious. Good thing they're cute. Maybe my new catchphrase.</p>

                    <p>I recently (in my life) found out I had ADHD and many of my past struggles make more sense. Relationships, school, jobs, it touches on all things in different ways, but what came to a head was how it relates to child rearing. These early years are non-stop and ADHD, in particular the executive dysfunction, is basically an impenetrable wall, or more accurately desribed, a deep well that I find myself unable to climb out of. I learned in my early adulthood how to overcome this which, unfortunately, involves dissassociating a little bit. I'm lucky to have a very patient partner in all of this. We both have our struggles but it would feel impossible without another person here to pass the baton to and to keep things in perspective. Another thing I've found myself doing is being even more dysfunctional in other aspects of my life as I put every ounce of my will into not being a deadbeat parent. Things like laundry, keeping up with friends, doing anything after bed time other than veg out... its a serious struggle but as the days go by and the kids get older and more independant its coming back, it really is, and I am thankful for that.</p>

                    <p>Something about ADHD is the oversharing. For the curious, lucky you!</p>

                    <p>Parents often only ever talk about their kids, its a good thing, but also, don't forget about the person you are. I am a person who has interests, hobbies, desires. Recently I started playing pickleball. Four years of sedentary life, working from home, it's not just about the Dad bod (which I rock proudly) but about stamina and strength. Pickleball is so low-impact, compared to other casual sports, the court being small, the ball not really not going that fast or far, and the fact that so many people play the game of all skill levels, means I have been able to jump in as a novice and get a good workout doing something fun. ADHD comes knocking again, I find normal exercise incredibly boring and I lose interest very quickly. Pickleball is a game and I like games, they are competative, and even though I am only on week 4 of playing the game, I'm finding the amount of physical effort is exactly where I'm at. I'm going to turn 40 next year and I suppose its time to let something like this stick. Plus, I get to befriend many old people. I'm surprised by how well people in their 70s can move.</p>

                    <p>That's all for today, folks. Feel free to email me: <a href='erikjustinportillo+blog@gmail.com'>erikjustinportillo@gmail.com</a>. If you're an old friend or anything don't be shy. I might not pick up the phone but I can write a damn long email and, plus, I'm more willing to send pics of whats going on in my life!</p>

                    <p>Goodbye~</p>
