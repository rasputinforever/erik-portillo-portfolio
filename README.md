## Introduction
This portfolio was created using a simple react-based router serving up various components onto the page. The page contains a Header, Footer, Introduction, a collection of Projects, Resume, and Contact information.

## Components
Most components are static blocks of information with text and links. Managing sections as components makes it easier to adjust and fix a specific section without affecting anything else on the page.

## array.map
The main Navigation component houses all other components and also imports the "database" information that maps out the array of project-objects. useEffect is used to set the projects hook so that the import accounts for any asynchronous importing of data.

## Styling
[Semantic UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) was used for this project which provided nice icons, gridding, cards, and more.
